          <p>Eric McDowell grew up on a small dairy farm just outside of New York City. When he was growing up, he always wanted a way to connect with his friends. One friend he connected with the most was a cow named Daisy. Eric loved connecting with his friend even though there was  a species gap. One day, Daisy cought bovine flu, though she survived. After that Eric dedicated himself to connecting people together. Eric enjoyed making cheese in his free time as a child, and often fed it to his cats, building connections. Throughout high school Eric thrived all around, but took to the digital arts. He trained hard at Caltech to eventually become one of Microsoft's forefront web designers. While working at Microsoft he helped the "connections" division, always allowing Microsoft to connect to their users. Eric started is own business, A-maz-ong, which garnered him much attention amongst computer science gurus. Eric worked on A-maz-ong for 8 years, where he connected over 2.5 million users. Though Eric was not fulfilled by his work done connecting people at A-maz-ong. On August 15th, 2008, Eric got an absolutely soul-shredding call from his mother saying that Daisy had died. Eric abondonned his multi-million dollar business to move out to Wausau, Wisconsin, where his parents now lived. Eric stayed there, consoling his devastated parents for a whole year, realising he made the best connection there that he ever made in his life. This immense connection is what encouraged Eric to start a new chapter of his life somewhere that understood connections as much as he did: InstantGramme. Now he resides in San Franciso, California, where he designed the InstantGramme website. Eric loves long walks on the beach and going to his favourite coffee shops along the bay. He has won over 60 Computer Science awards, along with 15 design awards, but nothing humbles Eric more than taking his cats for a walk along the bay. He was valedictorian of his Caltech class, along with having the Smith Scholarship.</p>
